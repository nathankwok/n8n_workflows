The view encompasses everything from query technical specifications (like SQL configuration and execution settings) to document metadata (such as names and visibility) and owner information (including email and group memberships). This semantic model is particularly useful for analyzing query configurations, document ownership patterns, and user permissions in the Omni system..

It establishes relationships between documents, their queries, and associated filter configurations, forming a complete picture of how filtering is implemented across documents. The structure allows for tracking filter usage, configurations, and relationships while maintaining document-level context and visibility controls.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION:\\\\nThe DOCUMENT_QUERY_FILTERS_SEMANTIC_VIEW, located in ANALYTICS_DEV.DEV_OMNI, provides a comprehensive framework for managing and analyzing query filters within the Omni document system. It connects documents to their queries and detailed filter configurations through a three-table structure, where documents serve as the top-level container, queries provide the execution context, and filter configurations specify the detailed filtering criteria. The view supports complex filter management by maintaining relationships between documents and their associated queries while tracking filter properties, operations, and values. This semantic view is particularly useful for analyzing filter usage patterns, understanding query configurations, and maintaining filter consistency across documents..

It combines document metadata including names, locations, and visibility settings with detailed owner information such as email addresses and group memberships. The view enables tracking document organization through folders while maintaining ownership context through the relationship between documents and user accounts. This semantic view is particularly useful for analyzing document management patterns, ownership distribution, and access control settings within the Omni system.. If you have a previous tool result of type cortex_analyst_text_to_sql in the history that is closely related to the current query, you can use the previous_related_tool_result_id parameter to pass it in so that the tool can use it to generate an accurate response.\\\"},{\\\"stringValue\\\":\\\"A Cortex Analyst text2sql tool with information limited to a single semantic model (name: users): OMNI_USERS:\\\\n- Database: ANALYTICS_DEV, Schema: DEV_OMNI\\\\n- Contains directory information for Omni user accounts and their associated group memberships.

It connects document queries to their parent documents through QUERY_DOCUMENT_IDENTIFIER to IDENTIFIER relationship, while documents are linked to their owners through OWNER_USER_ID to USER_ID relationship. The view encompasses everything from query technical specifications (like SQL configuration and execution settings) to document metadata (such as names and visibility) and owner information (including email and group memberships). This semantic model is particularly useful for analyzing query configurations, document ownership patterns, and user permissions in the Omni system..

It establishes relationships between documents, their queries, and associated filter configurations, forming a complete picture of how filtering is implemented across documents. The structure allows for tracking filter usage, configurations, and relationships while maintaining document-level context and visibility controls.\\\\n\\\\nDESCRIPTION:\\\\nThe DOCUMENT_QUERY_FILTERS_SEMANTIC_VIEW, located in ANALYTICS_DEV.DEV_OMNI, provides a comprehensive framework for managing and analyzing query filters within the Omni document system. It connects documents to their queries and detailed filter configurations through a three-table structure, where documents serve as the top-level container, queries provide the execution context, and filter configurations specify the detailed filtering criteria. The view supports complex filter management by maintaining relationships between documents and their associated queries while tracking filter properties, operations, and values. This semantic view is particularly useful for analyzing filter usage patterns, understanding query configurations, and maintaining filter consistency across documents..

It combines document metadata including names, locations, and visibility settings with detailed owner information such as email addresses and group memberships. The view enables tracking document organization through folders while maintaining ownership context through the relationship between documents and user accounts. This semantic view is particularly useful for analyzing document management patterns, ownership distribution, and access control settings within the Omni system.. If you have a previous tool result of type cortex_analyst_text_to_sql in the history that is closely related to the current query, you can use the previous_related_tool_result_id parameter to pass it in so that the tool can use it to generate an accurate response.\\\"},{\\\"stringValue\\\":\\\"A Cortex Analyst text2sql tool with information limited to a single semantic model (name: users): OMNI_USERS:\\\\n- Database: ANALYTICS_DEV, Schema: DEV_OMNI\\\\n- Contains directory information for Omni user accounts and their associated group memberships.

This semantic view is particularly useful for queries related to user access control, group membership analysis, and user account status monitoring.. If you have a previous tool result of type cortex_analyst_text_to_sql in the history that is closely related to the current query, you can use the previous_related_tool_result_id parameter to pass it in so that the tool can use it to generate an accurate response.\\\"}]}}},{\\\"key\\\":\\\"ai.observability.agent.planning.tool.name\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"arrayValue\\\":{\\\"values\\\":[{\\\"stringValue\\\":\\\"document_queries\\\"},{\\\"stringValue\\\":\\\"document_query_filters\\\"},{\\\"stringValue\\\":\\\"documents\\\"},{\\\"stringValue\\\":\\\"users\\\"}]}}},{\\\"key\\\":\\\"ai.observability.agent.planning.tool.parameters\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"arrayValue\\\":{\\\"values\\\":[{\\\"stringValue\\\":\\\"{\\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"check_metric_distribution\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"The additional metrics that we should extract from the data to make sure that we understand the distribution of each components used to compute the aggregation metrics.
